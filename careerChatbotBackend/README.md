# Career Chatbot Backend

A **FastAPI** application that uses **Tavily** (search engine) and **Gemini** (Google Generative AI) to answer user questions. This chatbot classifies and processes queries, optionally performing PDF-based embeddings and similarity searches for more detailed answers.

---

## Features

1. **Tavily Integration**  
   - Searches real-time information or recent events.  
   - Uses `langchain_community` tools to invoke Tavilyâ€™s API.

2. **Gemini (Google Generative AI)**  
   - Provides classification and response generation.  
   - Supports PDF-based vector searches before generating an answer.

3. **FastAPI REST Endpoints**  
   - Exposes a single `/chatbot/get_response` endpoint for sending user prompts.  
   - Returns JSON responses with classification, Tavily search results, and AI-generated text.

4. **PDF Knowledge (Optional)**  
   - Demonstrates how to load a PDF with `PyPDFLoader`, embed it, and search for relevant pages.
